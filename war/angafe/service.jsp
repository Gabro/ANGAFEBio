		<h1>OUR SERVICE</h1>
		<p>How our organic food delivery service Works, pure and simple.
		We offer 100% certified organic food deliveries right to your door year round.. Produce is chosen based on what’s in season, and is always as local as possible. The variety of food changes from week to week, but is generally 2/3rds vegetables and 1/3rd fruit.
		When you accept our two box trial offer you will receive two deliveries of organic produce. Deliveries are weekly OR every other week by your choosing. Testing our service twice will give you a taste of the quantity and variety that’s typical from delivery to delivery.
		After the first two boxes – box size and delivery frequency can be adjusted to suit the needs of your Household. We’re able to customize your delivery frequency and contents by recording which items you don’t like or want. We will make sure your dislikes never find their way into your box. We’ll also take note of the items you love and – when we have them available to us – we’ll supplement with them!
		Go here right now to see how easy it is to get your own  organic foods delivered right to your door with Free Shipping -  no obligation & no contract (that you can stop & re-start any time you like)</p>
